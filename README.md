# 🧠 Employee Attrition Prediction using Deep Learning (ANN)

This repository contains a Deep Learning (ANN) model built to predict **employee attrition** using HR dataset features.  
The goal of this project is to understand which employee characteristics influence attrition and to build a baseline ANN model for classification.

## 📌 Project Summary

This is **not an end-to-end deployment project** — it focuses mainly on:

- Data exploration  
- Preprocessing & feature encoding  
- Designing and training a Deep Learning model  
- Evaluating model performance  
- Visualizing accuracy & loss curves  

The project can be extended later with deployment, dashboards, or explainability methods.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-Learn
